# SOIL-PROPERTIES-PREDICTION-BY-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
This study integrates Google Earth Engine data and advanced modeling techniques to map soil nutrients. Using NDVI, DEM, and LST, we predict soil nutrient values with Scorpan model, supervised classification, and linear regression. Accessible remote sensing data from Google Earth Engine is pivotal for this analysis.
