# SOIL-PROPERTIES-PREDICTION-BY-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
This study integrates Google Earth Engine data and advanced modeling techniques to map soil nutrients. Using NDVI, DEM, and LST, we predict soil nutrient values with Scorpan model, supervised classification, and linear regression. Accessible remote sensing data from Google Earth Engine is pivotal for this analysis.

Scorpan is a mnemonic for an empirical quantitative descriptions of relationships between soil and environmental factors with a view to using these as soil spatial prediction functions for the purpose of Digital soil mapping. It is an adaptation of Hans Jenny's five factors not for explanation of soil formation, but for empirical descriptions of relationships between soil and other spatially referenced factors.

S = f(s,c,o,r,p,a,n), where

S = soil classes or attributes (to be modeled)
f = function
s = soil, other or previously measured properties of the soil at a point
c = climate, climatic properties of the environment at a point
o = organisms, including land cover and natural vegetation or fauna or human activity
r = relief, topography, landscape attributes
p = parent material, lithology
a = age, the time factor
n = spatial or geographic position
